  The Owl Club is a remarkable remnant of the Victorian period of Cape Town,
  South Africa, being a gentleman’s dining club formed in 1894 to provide a
  social meeting-place for those with an interest in the liberal arts and
  science. The members are entertained and informed by a strong tradition of
  excellent speakers and a high standard of music.

  ## Background to the name

  It was the wife of the first Secretary, C. G. Lowinger, that coined the
  name. Soon after the genesis of the idea of its formation, four men sat in
  the twilight near the Royal Observatory in Cape Town discussing what it
  should be called. W. E. Ranby, the first chronicler of the Club, takes up
  the tale: “Into the gathered darkness came Mrs Lowinger with the natural
  inquiry, ‘Why are you all sitting here in the dark like a lot of owls?’ ‘The
  very name for our Club!’ they cried, and the Owl Club it was called and
  remains” (Ranby 1952: 7). Members are designated as “Brother Owl” or Owl
  so-and-so. The first formal meeting of the Owl Club took place on 1 October
  1894.

  ## Location of the Club

  Down the years, the Club has met in various venues in the City of Cape Town.
  Between 1975 and 1988 it met at the Cape Town Club (formerly the City and
  Civil Service Club) in Queen Victoria Street. Since 1998, the venue for
  meetings has been the Kelvin Grove Club at Newlands, Cape Town, usually in
  the Grill Room.

  ## The Club today

  The Owl Club maintains a tradition of monthly dinners for Members and their
  male guests; “black tie” is the customary plumage. The normal pattern of
  each meeting comprises a main speaker, always a guest, followed by a musical
  item which may be provided by an Owl or by an outside performer. There
  follows a bar interval, when the Owls and their guests move around to chat,
  often congregating around the bar. The second part of the meeting features a
  shorter talk by an Owl which, because of its purposeful inconsequence, is
  nicknamed “The Waste Paper Basket”. A second musical item closes the
  evening.

  By convention, speakers are requested to avoid such references to religion,
  sexual matters and party politics as may give offence; English is the only
  language used for the addresses. If possible, the delivery should be what
  one of our great former presidents referred to as “A light touch with
  something behind it”. The speaker is not subjected to interjections, nor is
  he required to answer questions after his address; and experience has shown
  that it is generally undesirable to invite them. The Press are not present
  but the proceedings are recorded and a monthly digest is circulated to
  Members.

  ## Membership

  Members are classified into one or more of five Faculties which best
  describe their main interest: Art, Drama, Literature, Music or Science. The
  category might mirror a Member's profession, though there are many Members
  who have an interest in one or more of the Membership categories without
  engaging in it professionally. Membership is by invitation only. The fitness
  of a prospective member is judged initially by his proposer and seconder,
  who present his curriculum vitæ for consideration by the Committee of the
  Owl Club. He should have demonstrated some distinction in his area; but the
  overriding criterion should be his ability to dwell in harmony with his
  fellow Owls. So, on occasion, members have been elected more for their
  “clubability” than for their distinction, and this is perfectly acceptable.

  ## Opening hours and reciprocal arrangements

  The Club meets on the third Tuesday of each month, with the exception of
  January; in December, to avoid a “bump” with the Christmas meeting of the
  Oxford and Cambridge Club, the meeting may take place on the previous
  Tuesday. Meetings commence at 8.00 p.m., preceded by a dinner (6.30 p.m. for
  7.00 p.m.) and last until about 10.30 p.m.

  The Owl Club enjoys reciprocal arrangements with the Savage Club of London
  and the Melbourne Savage Club in Australia.

  ## Further information

  The origins and history of the Owl Club from 1894 to 1950 are recorded by W.
  E. Ranby in *The Owl Club 1894-1950* (Cape Town: The Owl Club, 1952). Eric
  Rosenthal and other Owls continued the account for the years 1951 to 1981 in
  a collective history, *The third Tuesday* (Cape Town: The Owl Club, 1982).
  For its centenary publication, the Club decided to compile an anthology
  based on the addresses to Owl Club members in the period since 1981:
  *The unjealous years: an Owl Club anthology, selected and edited by James A. Henry, with illustrations by Tony Grogan, Joe Lister and Townley Johnson*
  (Cape Town: The Owl Club, 1996).
